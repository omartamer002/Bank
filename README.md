#### *Banking Application in GoLang*
This is a Banking application I created using GoLang. This application does several operations, it lets the user:
1. View their current balance.
2. Deposit money
3. Withdraw money
4. Exit the application.
#### *In this project, I used various GoLang features, e.g:*
- Variables
- Constants
- Functions
- Loops (For & Switch)
- If Statements
- Writing to file & Reading from file
- Error handling practices
- Importing special packages
